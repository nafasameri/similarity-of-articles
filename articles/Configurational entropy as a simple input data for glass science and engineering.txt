Abstract: The current study seeks to propose new input data for glass science and engineering based on the simple calculations of the configurational entropy. Initially, the configurational entropy of the 15,000 silicate-based glasses with different amounts of alkali or alkaline earth oxide additives (10, 15, and 25 mol%), which were extracted from the SciGlass database, was calculated using S Conf=− R∑ i= 1 x x i ln x i formula. In the mentioned formula, S Conf is the configurational entropy, R is the gas constant, and x i is the molar fraction of i element. Then, the relation between entropy and glass properties was theoretically investigated in three conditions. The results indicated that the entropy of the studied glasses is in the range of 0.03 R to 2.15 R. The results showed positive or negative slopes in the entropy-T g curves for different glass compositions. The found reasons behind the various trends between the entropy and T …
